# DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)

Single Source of Truth – Each piece of knowledge or logic should exist in only one place in the system.

Avoid Code Duplication – Repeated logic should be abstracted into functions, classes, or modules.

Improves Maintainability – Changes need to be made in only one location, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

Enhances Readability – Less repetition leads to cleaner, more concise code.

Encourages Abstraction – Promotes identifying patterns and generalizing solutions.

Reduces Bugs – Fewer copies of logic mean fewer places where bugs can be introduced.

Applies Beyond Code – Also relevant to documentation, configurations, and database schemas.

Promotes Reusability – Common logic becomes modular and reusable across different parts of the system.

Faster Onboarding – New developers can understand systems quicker with less duplicated logic.

Eases Refactoring – Modular and centralized code is simpler to refactor or extend.
